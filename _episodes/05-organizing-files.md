## Organizing files

Now that we've gone over some fundamental shell concepts, let's walk through one way we could combine them to tackle a common file-organization task.

First, let's move into the directory `shell-lesson/images`:
~~~
$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson/images
~~~
{: .bash}

In this directory, we have 30 TIFF files and 30 JPEG files. The TIFF files are our master copies of the images, and the JPEG files are access derivatives. Instead of having them mixed together in one place, we want to organize them into two folders called `master` and `access`.

(In real life, of course, they would be a collection of different images. For the purposes of this workshop, they're all copies of this cool cat from the [National Library of Medicine](https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101611398-img)):
